                    <h1>Web Design</h1>
                    <p class="content">I have been designing web sites since 2013. As a web designer it is
                        important to me that I create web sites that use the web design and development
                        industry's best practices to ensure that the web site is user friendly and 
                        readily formatted for prime search engine optimization. It is important for me
                        to work with my clients to make sure we are meeting both the needs and expectations
                        of the company as well as the site's users.<br>
                        I am a web designer that mainly constructs sites for individuals and small
                        businesses. Please feel free to take a look at some of my work and contact me
                        if you think I would be a good match for your small business web design needs.</p>
