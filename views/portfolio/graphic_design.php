                        It is important that the web designer you choose to build your website
                        has graphic design experience. Many elements and principles of design
                        are needed in the creation of a website. While it is important to have
                        a professional look to your web site, graphic design plays a role in
                        ensuring the content is organized in a user-friendly fashion and that
                        the feel of the website matches your small business' brand and communicate
                        your message. Graphic design plays a role in both the look and feel of
                        the site as well as improving the user experience.<br>
