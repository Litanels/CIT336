                    <p class="content">One of the <a href="/services/services.php">services</a> that I provide is
                        content writing. The written content of a web site is important for two reasons.
                        First, potential clients will be looking for specific information on your web page.
                        When I write web content I make sure it is organized in a way that will help
                        your clients find what they are looking for. Second, content writing is a critical
                        element in web marketing. By ensuring that the text of your web site utilizes keywords
                        in the appropriate locations, I improve the SEO of your web site which in turn
                        helps potential clients find your site.</p>
